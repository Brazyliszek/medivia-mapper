Demo does not contain full map at all zoom levels.
Maps and ore marks were downloaded from wiki, and then generated by scripts.

=== Mapper ===
Mapper accepts url parameters to share position example: www.blabla.com/mapper?x=2048&y=-2047&z=7&zoom=2
Mapper itself uses leaflet library, with small modifications.

==== Generating maps ====

Maps folder is structured as following: floor/zoom/x/y.png
I wrote python script that merges images straight from medivia cache folder as 768px tiles and exports them as leaflet tilemaps.
If u want to generate maps urself, i included "create.py", where you have to specify 2 paths, one for medivia cache folder and the second, where to save generated maps.
It requires pillow python library https://pypi.org/project/pillow/ and generating could take couple mins (depends on your CPU and amount of files in cache folder)

=== Generating ores ===

Similar thing as above, use python script "markers.py" on your config.otml
